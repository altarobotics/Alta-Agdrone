Notion of fertilization N: reducing the usage of nitrogen could increase the sustainability and reduce the level of polution 
Notion of nutrient management tools :  Managing nutrients is referred to as the 4Rs: Right rate, Right timing, Right source, and Right placement.  ( Rate, Timing, Source, Placement ) 
Some estimation from drone imagery tools  with the components ( N P K Bacteria Calcium & Mg Mo B )  
It could help to know where to take the sample of soil for instance if we want to make an efficient soil testing. Soil testing appropriate at the right place. 
With the photogrammetry ( 3d mapping ) we could track the erosion and environmental impacts. 
Proposition of nutrient replacement in some zone with very low ndvi â€“ avoid excess of nutriements 
( we can see how we can predict nutrients replacement ) 
It could help to predict seasonal rotation if the soil is in such a bad state

There is 4 mains methods of fertilization : 

1-Foliar fertilization pro and con (  emergency soil issues / low greenery )
more effective in case of restriction of soil nutriement 
foliar fertilizers are most effective when soil problems occur that resotrt nutrient availability
not good in case of contamination because the liquid can spread quickly directly applied on the leaves of growing crop. 
placement application means to apply the fertilizer near plant rows within a field
Addition of secondary element: magnesium, nitrogen, calcium, sulfur - good irrigation until perfect state

2-Broadcast fertilization ( pre-season / or great greenery with issues )
better with the ndvi probably low before the planting / for cool season of grass ideal for the need of N
ideal for need in phosphorus and nitrogen 
broadcasting means to uniformly distribute fertilizer over an entire field
Addition of oligo element: iron, manganese, copper, boron, chlorine 

3-Banding fertilization ( growing season / greenery )
Consist on putting the fertilizer next to the crop / dryland cropping systems and optimized nitro 
Provide a zone of high nutrient concentration to improve root interception, stimulate growth and reduce nutrient fixation
Increases root contact and minimizes surface nutrient loss
Addition of secondary element: magnesium, nitrogen, calcium, sulfur 

4-Fertigation ( contamination diseases / mid greenery ) 
Fertigation is to add fertilizer into the irrigation water drip - furrow and sprinkler
healthier plants can grow because they are less likely to contract , this method is good for the environment
If arable surface add nutrients: nitrogen, nitrate, phosphorus and potassium
