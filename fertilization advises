Notion of fertilization N: reducing the usage of nitrogen could increase the sustainability and reduce the level of polution 
Notion of nutrient management tools :  Managing nutrients is referred to as the 4Rs: Right rate, Right timing, Right source, and Right placement.  ( Rate, Timing, Source, Placement ) 
Some estimation from drone imagery tools  with the components ( N P K Bacteria Calcium & Mg Mo B )  
It could help to know where to take the sample of soil for instance if we want to make an efficient soil testing. Soil testing appropriate at the right place. 
With the photogrammetry ( 3d mapping ) we could track the erosion and environmental impacts. 
Proposition of nutrient replacement in some zone with very low ndvi â€“ avoid excess of nutriements 
( we can see how we can predict nutrients replacement ) 
It could help to predict seasonal rotation if the soil is in such a bad state

There is 4 mains methods of fertilization : 

1-Foliar fertilization pro and con (  emergency soil issues / low greenery )
more effective in case of restriction of soil nutriement 
foliar fertilizers are most effective when soil problems occur that resotrt nutrient availability such as iron availability in high pH soils
emergency measure to correct a nutritional deficiency. not good in case of contamination because the liquid can spread quickly
directly applied on the leaves of  growing crop. the effect is limited because the micronutrients can absorb only a few part
Foliar applications means to apply liquid fertilizer in spray so that it settles on leaves of plants
placement application means to apply the fertilizer near plant rows within a field
Addition of secondary element: magnesium, nitrogen, calcium, sulfur - good irrigation until perfect state

2-Broadcast fertilization ( pre-season / or great greenery with issue in combinasion with nitrogen and phororus focus chemical products )
better with the ndvi probably low before the planting
for cool season of grass ideal for the need of N
ideal for large areas in a least time
disadvantaged in no-still systems where immobile nutrients may remain stranded on the soils surface
ideal for need in phosphorus and nitrogen
broadcasting means to uniformly distribute fertilizer over an entire field
Addition of oligo element: iron,manganese, copper,boron,chlorine 

3-Banding fertilization ( growing season / greenery )
Consist on putting the fertilizer next to the crop
Dryland cropping systems / optimized nitro 
Provide a zone of high nutrient concentration to improve root interception, stimulate growth and reduce nutrient fixation
ideal for seed row - advantages of less fuel consumption and less soil disturbance
Increases root contact and minimizes surface nutrient loss
Addition of secondary element: magnesium, nitrogen, calcium, sulfur 

4-Fertigation ( contatmination diseases / mid greenery ) 
fertigation is to add fertilizer into the irrigation water drip - furrow and sprinkler
with fertigation growers can save money time labor and water because they have more control over what is fertilized  and what is not
healthier plants can grow because they are less likely to contract diseases good for the environment
It is the use of any fertigation system. the goal is to adress the root not good in a very good ndvi or in season of great water the precipitation can washed out the nutrient from the soil
good to increase crop yield instead of threat a disease. Reduced he groundwarter contamination and reudce the weed pressure which not use the total fertilizer a few quantity could be driven by the water irrigation.
Expensive to put in place
If arable surface add nutrients primary nitrogen, nitrate, phosphorus and potassium
