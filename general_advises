A small portion of the surface of the field is red for 18.4% with an index of -0.15 
which means the area has a lot of segments to be taken in consideration for the health of the crops and the condition of the soil.
The vast majority of the surface which have a value yellow for 40%  between 0.1 and 0.2 which means the photosynthesis activity is very low. 
The good condition between 0.5 and 0.7 covers another portion of the field with an average of 21%.  
Only 22% of the field with a value between 0.7 and 0.9 of the surface has an excellent photosynthesis activity which means the surface is in very good condition and dont need additional particular treatment.
In general, overall the surface is in a good condition with an average value of 0.395.
Please consider applying these recommendations below in order to have better statistics and health of both the soil and the crops.

portion area : small ( 0 - 20% ) / medium ( 20% - 40% ) / majority ( 40% - 100% )

condition : 
not alarming no photosynthetic activities ( minus to -0.1 )
not alarming soil probably ready of preason ( -0.1 - 0.2 )
alarming - potential contamination  0.2 - 0.4 )
not good - ( 0.4 - 0.6 )
good - ( 0.6 - 0.7 )
excellent ( 0.7 - 0.9 )

interpretation : 
- presence of stone or streams 
- without grass /  preseason 
- emergency situation / observation required 
- contamination treatment or soil treatment  needed
-  good greenery / great photosynthetic activities 
-  excellent greenery / excellent photosynthetic activities

Index

-1 à 0.1 
Non-photosynthetic activity:
Stone-Streams 
Remove stones, sand or snow if needed 

0.4 à 0.6 
Low photosynthetic activity
If arable surface add nutrients primary nitrogen, nitrate, phosphorus and potassium - low irrigation before good state, then strong irrigation after good state
0.6 à 0.7
Good photosynthetic activity
Addition of secondary element: magnesium, nitrogen, calcium, sulfur - good irrigation until perfect state
0.7 à 0.9
Greenery-Excellent photosynthetic activity
Addition of oligo element: iron,manganese, copper,boron,chlorine - maintain low irrigation keep the perfect state
0.9 à 1
Areas or objects that reflect more brightness than natural plant activity 


Removing foreign elements which are dangerous to the health of culture
