Notion of water rate absorbtion regarding the types of crops 
We must monitor the Salinaty tolerance : it is the hability for the crops to absorb the salt inside the water 
Crops evapotransmission – Crops water needs – Peak evaporation 
Dates when crops begin and ends  
Notion of irrigation water need and supply ( litre seconds / hectares ) 
Determiner la vitesse à laquelle l'eau devrait etre active
/ determiner la duree sur une semaine  ou 2 jours / sur 24h en continue ou sur 4h à savoir 87.5 l/s for 2 days instead of 7 days  25 l/s 
We could always consult some specialist in irrigation to perform our database

And the risk to be under irrigation  with the drawbacks 

1-Surface irrigation
Very interesting for the cultures in the deep valley side
less expensive to put in place and need less of maintenance 
good to irrigate the roots and in the field with stones in general with low level of ndvi
Not recemmended in cases of diseases detection or crops contamination

2-Sprinkle irrigation
Very simple to put in place with tuble and ergonomics surface
Very efficient for ndvi very low for treating diseasess
Not recommended in case of great sunshine with possibilities of evaporation

3-Micro irrigation
Micro irrigation is a technic very spread for the agriculture of large surface in particular for the cultures of wines and orchide
the advantage is that allow to distribute the quantity needed for each crops 
recommended in high maintenance with middle level of ndvi index adequate with fertilizer liquide
